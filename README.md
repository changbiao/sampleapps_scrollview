Sample UIScrollview
===================

Every time you create a form you’re gonna probably have some UITextField in it. When you have a lot of them, it’s very commom to have the UITextField hidden behind the Keyboard. I’ve searched all over for a solution to the problem of textfields hidden behind the keyboard and found that the solution is to use a UIScrollView. It’s possible to scroll some items over the keyboard and animate them so it goes up as smooth as Apple’s own applications
